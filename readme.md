Because Security is one of the main concerns in my app, I tested for each model:
- ✅ Models
- ✅ User Foreign Key
- ☑️ User Access to items
- ✅ Forms
- ✅ Templates (HTML pages)
- ✅ URLs
- ❌ Direct Links to other pages

For the HomePage:
- ✅ Templates (HTML pages)
- ✅ URLs
- ☑️ User Access to items

For Each User:
- ✅ User Singup
- ✅ User Login
- ☑️ Email reset Password
- ☑️ Templates (HTML pages)
